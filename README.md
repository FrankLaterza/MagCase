# MagCase

This project was a self opening AirMag case. The base was 3d printed and the the code was executed on an arduino uno. The mag case has a rfid reader, so the client could use a card to tigger a light sequence and open the case. The case is also rechargable and has a button to open it.

The code shows and example of a non-blocking rfid reader code. It also shows an example of a non-blocking light sequence
